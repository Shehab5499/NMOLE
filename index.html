                <p>
                Back in 2016, <b>N MOLE's first project was Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger.
                We managed to design, fabricate, and operate a real industrial equipment for the first time.</b>
                After suffering a lot, we could find our way out to do something that completely improbable to be achieved by students only.
                The first step was the most difficult one, however, it was also a very remarkable one. The one that enforced every other step further.
                <br>
                Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger is one of the most common thermal industrial equipment and N MOLE till now has implemented this equipment <b>3 times</b>
                <b>(in 2016, 2018, and finally 2019 in the mechanical branch).</b>
                We successfully could learn and coach how to <b>design, fabricate, and operate a shell-and-tube heat exchanger</b> from A to Z.
                <br>
                The process that was founded in our first project was and still adapted to perform and lead the way to this.
                <br>
                It all begins within N MOLE's staff members who complete all the following steps to qualify themselves to coach this experience and share its knowledge to others.
                N MOLE coaches formulate a practical problem and struggle their way to its solution.
                N MOLE coaches do it early with no guidance and you do it now with our guidance and care. But after all we all do the same process to gain similar valuable experience.
                
                <br><b><u>N MOLE's Project Recipe:</u></b>
                <br>
                1. Acquiring and educating the skills to search on necessary technical information
                <br>
                2. Performing and supervising presentation skills to communicate our findings with the rest of the team
                <br>
                3. Brainstorming and cooperating to formulate our problems and possible solutions leading to solving our final case study
                <br>
                4. Procurement and purchasing parts and services needed to fabricate the equipment at the lowest possible cost
                <br>
                5. Fabricate the equipment and perform necessary pre-startup tests
                <br>
                6. Finally, the big day, the operation day where our dream comes true
                <br>
                7. Summarize our entire experience in a technical report (the proposal)
                <br>
                8. Perform a final presentation to communicate our work professionally to everyone.
                <br>
                9. Evaluating all participating teams regarding technicality, teamwork, and their ability to communicate their work.
                <br>
                10. Announcement of the winner team and celebrating the end of a matchless journey

                Our second step, in 2017, was about an interesting equipment that imply the physical phenomenon of liquid-liquid extraction.
                It is rarely known by any engineering discipline other than chemical engineering and it is rarely visualized in our life yet it exists in numerous industries purifying the most complicated mixture.
                N MOLE's second project has revealed and conquered another challenge by allowing students to see and interact with liquid-liquid extraction directly and not only through textbooks and pictures.
                <br><b>Case Study</b><br>
                    Participating engineering students in each team must perform extensive research about the physical and engineering concepts underlying liquid-liquid extraction and communicate their findings in weekly presentations<br>
                    <b>Design, fabrication, and operation of a liquid-liquid extraction packed column</b> is due to 3 weeks later starting from the beginning of the project<br>
                    Each team must figure out how to build the equipment with minimum cost<br>
                    Maximum degree of separation must be achieved<br>
                    Organizing tasks and effective communication within in each team is highly considered and evaluated<br>

                Water treatment are one of the most vital processes in any plant. Together, N MOLE could make a full water treatment operation that purifies dirty water that is highly contaminated to a clean and usable water with dedication and teamwork.

                    With another exciting and famous thermal equipment, our project "Air-Cooled Heat Exchanger" was finally launched in 2021 for mechanical engineering students.
                    The implementation of this project was a masterpiece beginning from the high spirit of each of the two participating teams till the end of the project with the well-organized and spectacular presentations.
                    <br>The project was special again with the extensive use of engineering software like <b>SolidWorks, COMSOL Mutliphysics, and MATLAB.</b>
                    Each was required to find various design aspects including thermal, mechanical, and pressure drop design considerations.
                    With every concept digested by a team's subgroup, it was presented to rest of the team in a time-efficient manner.

                Yet another unique challenge encountered and conquered by N MOLE, building a unit process. In Summer 2022, N MOLE has landed its biodiesel batch reactor project. Regardless of the complexity of the reactive systems, N MOLE could again terminate all the technical obstacles and achieve the goal of creating a biodiesel reactor from scratch.
                <br><b>Case Study</b><br>
                Biodiesel product was required to be produced from waste recycled food oil and its reaction with methanol.<br>
                Each participating must <b>design, fabricate, and operate a batch reactor</b> that undergoes the reaction and yields the desired product, the biodiesel.<br>
                All team members should acquire the technicality for the project and communicate effectively to complete and report their work<br>
                <b>A final report and presentation about the entire project are submitted and performed by each team to N MOLE's academic committee head</b><br>
                <i>The project was finalized announcing the winner <b>TEAM 1 üåü‚ú®</b></i>
